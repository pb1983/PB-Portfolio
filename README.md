# PB-Portfolio

## This site was created to share my finished projects with other students, instructors, and potential employers. I've applied our daily lessons on CSS to build this page, with special focus on positioning, display, and responsive design.

## Please note that since we are in the early stages of the boot camp, the only project in the Work section that was created by myself is the "Pre-Work Study Guide". For the purposes of this assignment the other links will forward to google.com as a placeholder until we have completed more assignments.
